          <p class="col-sm-6 text-left small">EC is located in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington,
                D.C. We're proud to serve our government clients from our nation's capital. We're 
                proud to be a part of the revitalization of the LeDroit Park area. And we're proud
                of the community itself: this place has history.<br/><br/>

                After the Civil War, Shaw was built by emancipated African Americans who
                constructed homes, opened businesses and started an independent bank here.
                Toward the end of the 19th century, the community came of age as a nucleus
                of black intellectual and cultural life: a magnet for artists, writers and
                intellectuals like Langston Hughes, Duke Ellington, Alain LeRoy Locke, Ella
                Fitzgerald, James Brown. We've named our conference rooms to honor them.</p>

          <p class="col-sm-6 text-left small">When riots erupted after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Shaw
                took a downward slide. But thanks to grassroots community renewal projects
                spearheaded by civic leaders, the decline didn't last.<br/><br/>

                Today, our neighborhood is a mix of offices, shops, row houses and 19th-century
                Victorian homes; professors, electricians, doctors and carpenters. It's a blend of
                families who've been here for generations, and young professionals just starting out.<br/><br/>

                In short: it's an edgy, urban area whose history runs deep, and whose future
                is actively unfolding.
