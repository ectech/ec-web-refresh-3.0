              <p>Evans &amp; Chambers Technology proudly sponsors a local youth soccer team coached by EC teammate, Phil. <a href="">Barca 97</a> is a year-round “futebol club” for players aged 15 – 16. Player development is highly valued, and the team practices twice per week and competes in 4 – 5 tournaments per season. Development includes the technical aspects of the sport, plus sport mentality and team spirit, determination, excellence, and humility.</p>
              <p>One Sunday, a group of us decided to check out one of the games to show our support in person. The dedication and discipline of the players and coaches was apparent and everyone enjoyed watching the game. EC wishes Barca 97 a fun, safe remainder of the playing season!</p>
