            <h1>Work for yourself.</h1>
            <p>Most of the time, our employees aren’t working in our offices. They’re on-site with our clients, often collaborating with third-party organizations in the process.
This means our people aren’t just the mouthpiece of EC; they’re also our hands and feet. We look for candidates who own what they do, who take responsibility for the results they deliver. People who, like entrepreneurs, use their own imagination to get the job done.</p>

            <h1>Ask:does it serve the client?</h1>
            <p>Customer service is one of those things people like to talk about... because it matters. At EC, we think cool ideas are great, but if it’s going to fly, it has to benefit the client.</p>

            <h1>Make friends with your team.  </h1>
            <p>It’s important to gel with your team when you’re collaborating at a client site. So we’ve put team-building at the core of our company culture. From wilderness ropes courses to competitive cooking lessons, we hold volunteer-planned, company-sponsored events several times a year. We also do regular happy hours, dinners at fine restaurants, summer picnics and holiday parties.</p>

            <h1>Stay hungry, keep learning.</h1>
            <p>Every year, we invest generously in paid training opportunities for our employees. We also partner with professional training companies for technical and non-technical team members, from IT to HR.
You’re not just a cog in the wheel here; at EC, you have access to executive management, the leverage to present ideas and be heard, and continual opportunities to expand your skill set by contributing to projects that interest you.<br/><br/><br/></p>
